# ComputerVision
Collection of projects for my Computer Vision class at Queens College

Projects are run by providing the necessary input.txt data files, and supplementary data.txt files if required.

## 
1. Image Histogram -- a simple project that will create a histogram of all the pixel values of the image
2. Median and Gauss Filter -- removes outliers from a binary image by smoothing it, either with the median filter or gaussian filter
3. Morphology -- cleanses salt/pepper from a binary image using morphological operations Opening and Closing
4. BiMean Gauss -- an automatic threshold selection algorithm to seperate the foreground from the background
5. Connected Components -- an algorithm to identify and label all of the different connected components of a binary image
6. Image Compression Using Skeleton -- an algorithm to compress a binary image by compressing it down to its 'skeleton'
7. Hough Transform -- an algorithm to identify edges of a binary image by entering 'votes' into the hough space. 
8. Image Compression Using Chain Coding -- an algorithm to compress a binary image by starting from the top and tracing around its edges recursively. 
9. Text Line Detection -- an algorithm to determine where the lines (of text) within a binary image would exist
